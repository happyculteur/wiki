##Â Running the wiki localy

If you want to enhance this wiki, you should see your changes localy on your computer. To do so, you need a few steps.

### Installation

You first need to install the needed packages, first you need to have the Python package manager and run this command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs pymdown-extensions
```

This will isntall all dependeces needed. That's all.

### Run a live server

Mkdocs offers us the possibility to run a local server in just one command, and debug very quickly our work. Just move to the root directory of this repo and run:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

You will then have access to the running server at the URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Finding doc

You will find a lot of docs about [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme on there respective pages (clickable links).

Now you are good to go. Have fun.
